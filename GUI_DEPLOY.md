# 🖱️ The "No-Coding" Upload Method (Easy Mode)

If the terminal is scary or not working, use the **Buttons** in VS Code!

**Pre-requisite**: You MUST have GitHub Desktop or Git installed (which we did earlier).

---

## Step 1: Click the "Source Control" Icon
1.  Look at the **Left Sidebar** in VS Code.
2.  Find the icon that looks like a **Y-shape** (forked line).
    *   *(It might have a blue number on it).*
3.  Click it.

## Step 2: "Publish to GitHub"
1.  You should see a big blue button that says **Publish to GitHub**.
    *   *(If you don't see it, look for a "Initialize Repository" button first, click that, then type a message like "first commit" in the box above and press Ctrl+Enter. Then the "Publish" button will appear).*
2.  Click **Publish to GitHub**.
3.  A menu will pop up at the **top** of the window.
4.  Select **"Publish to GitHub private repository"**.

## Step 3: Authenticate (Log In)
1.  VS Code will ask permission to sign in to GitHub.
2.  Click **Allow**.
3.  Your browser will open. Click **"Authorize Visual Studio Code"**.
4.  It might ask for your password.

## Step 4: Done!
Once the little spinning circle stops, your code is on GitHub!

## Now, go to Vercel
Now that the code is online, you can go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and follow **Step 3** from the other guide (`PUBLIC_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`) to connect it.

**You did it without typing a single command!** 🎉
